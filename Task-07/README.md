# APPROACH

Throughout the project i was able to understand how to use flutter , how apps work,and so on . Even though i am not familiar with js which made me depend on other sources for the code,
i was able to understand the importance of it and i am halfway learning all of them . Since due to time limit i was not able to complete the particular task properly.
