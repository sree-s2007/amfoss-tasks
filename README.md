# CineScope Dashboard – SQL Integration Task

 **You’ve just joined CineScope Studios as a data intern.**  
 Your mission? Help the team build an interactive movie database visualizer. The frontend is ready — now it’s your job to bring it to life with real data. You’ll import movie records, connect a MySQL database, and make sure everything works smoothly inside the CineScope desktop app.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Learn and apply basic **SQL (MySQL)** skills  
- Import data from a **CSV file** into a MySQL database using Python  
- Integrate a **PySide6** UI with the database  
- Enable exporting of the displayed data to a CSV file

---

### Steps to Run the Project (Ubuntu)

1. **Set up the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the file**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
 


## 🗂 What You’re Given

- A `movies.csv` file with movie data  
- A ready-to-use **PySide6 UI** (`dashboard.py`)  
- A [demo video](https://github.com/AadarshM07/CineScope/blob/main/demo.mp4) showing the expected functionality

---

## 🛠 What You Have to Do

1. **Import Data into MySQL**  
   Write a Python script (`import_csv.py`) to:  
   - Create a MySQL table for storing movie data  
   - Read the contents of `movies.csv`  
   - Insert the records into the database

2. **Connect the UI to MySQL and Implement Functionalities**  
   The provided UI (`dashboard.py`) is built using PySide6. Your job is to:  
   - Connect it to your MySQL database using Python (e.g., `PyMySQL` or `mysql-connector-python`)  
   - Make the **Search** and **Column Selection** buttons functional — they should generate custom queries based on the user's input and selected filters  
   - Display the resulting data dynamically in the visualizer table

3. **Export to CSV**  
   Implement the **Export CSV** button so that:  
   - It exports the **currently displayed data** from the visualizer table to a new `.csv` file  
   - The exported file should reflect any applied filters or selections made in the UI

##  My Implementation 

### Files
- `dashboard.py` → Dashboard with search, filter, and export.
- `import_csv.py` → Loads data into `movies.db` from `movies.csv`.
- `movies.csv` → Dataset.
- `movies.db` → SQLite database generated after running import script.

### How to Run
1. Run `python3 import_csv.py` → creates `movies.db`.
2. Run `python3 dashboard.py` → opens the Movie Dashboard.
3. Use search, filter, and column selection.
4. Click **Export** to save filtered results as CSV.

### Features Done
- Search by multiple fields  
- Column selection  
- Export to CSV
